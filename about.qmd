During this tutorial we will see the basics of R and how to handle some data.

To do so, we will use several packages such as:

-   `ggplot2`
-   `tidyr`
-   `dplyr`
-   `readr`
-   `magrittr`

The data we will use are all gathered in the package [PlanktonData](https://kmgjan.github.io/PlanktonData/)
